# TODO: Known problems:
# - see TODO and %%
# - resulting john.pot and mixed.potpw are incomplete
# - mixed.potpw should be disabled and removed when it turned out to
#   be useless
# - hardcoded paths
# - hardcoded list of hash formats; hardcoded fixes
# - submitted/ should be public
# - it does not handle HEX and/or hashcat's .pot format
# - it may interfere with scp of /home/results giving inconsisting
#   state (or may not?)

# Usage: just run in any private folder without arguments.
# It needs hashes in canonical form under
# /home/results/hashes-canon/
# For mixed.potpw, it needs original file at
# /home/share/hashes/pro_hashes/pro_hashes.txt
# It fills
# /home/results/cracked/*.txt
# /home/results/uncracked/*.pw
# /home/results/john.pot
# /home/results/mixed.potpw
