# Scripts used in CMIYC 2018

These scripts were used by [john-users team](https://openwall.info/wiki/john/contests) in [Crack Me If You Can](https://twitter.com/CrackMeIfYouCan) 2018 contest at DEFCON. See our [write-up](http://openwall.com/lists/john-users/2018/08/27/10).

## Warning: Low Quality

These scripts were written in a rush aiming at 80% good work during only 2 days under supervision by the author. So they are dirty prototypes or worse. They are published to show some ideas and to show how it could be done under pressure with dirty ad-hoc solutions. Some design decisions were made against quality for simplicity. Also there are defects due to mistakes. The defects were not fixed and will not be fixed. Most probably, there are unknown defects too...

It is a snapshot. If something grows from the scripts into more mature tools, it'll be published separately (maybe [here](https://github.com/AlekseyCherepanov/contest-tools)).
