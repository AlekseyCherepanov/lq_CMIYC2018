# Script to check a list of parts against cracks to find combinations

# Copyright Â© 2018 Aleksey Cherepanov <lyosha@openwall.com>

# Usage:
# python check-parts.py file_with_parts
# - results/cracked/* should be lists with cracked passwords;
# - it creates file_with_parts.check_found with the found passwords.
# Prints:
# - parts with number of uses (1 part used twice in 1 passwords gives +2)
# - number of passwords and stats by length
# - possible parts based on remaining tails with stats

# TODO: Known problems:
# - hardcoded paths
# - see TODO and %%
# - creates files silently
# - UI could be improved
